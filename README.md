# emotion_recognition_ECG_GSR
ECG and GSR signal processing and data analysis

<hr>

Aim of this project was to detect and analyzing emotional 
reactions to stressful and calm scenarios in virtual reality game.  

ECG and GSR signals were recorded during gameplay, then  processed 
and analyzed using Python. HRV parameters were extracted from ECG 
signals, using `pyHRV` library.  
Statistical analysis (Mann-Whitney U test) showed unambiguous difference in reactions.
